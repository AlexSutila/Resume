\textbf{Audio Recorder on FPGA Hardware} \hfill \textbf{Academic Project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed audio serialization/deserialization modules using combinational and sequential logic.
    \item Integrated custom modules with IP memory to enable 2-second audio recording and playback.
    \item Supported multiple selectable memory blocks for audio storage.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cloud Autoscaling \& ML Pipelines} \hfill \textbf{Academic Projects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built scalable AWS-based systems using S3, SQS, EC2, and Lambda.
    \item Developed autoscaling infrastructure to manage EC2 instances based on workload demand.
    \item Created a serverless video facial recognition pipeline triggered via web uploads.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Embedded Systems Programming} \hfill \textbf{Academic Projects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Programmed sensors and actuators (motors, displays, IMUs, encoders) in low-level C/C++.
    \item Developed navigation models on the Pololu 3pi+ for slopes and path following.
    \item Built an ARM-based tilt-controlled maze game using LCD and accelerometer input.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Game Console Emulators \& Debug Tools} \hfill \textbf{Personal Project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built \href{https://github.com/alexsutila/gbemulator}{DMG-GameBoy} and \href{https://github.com/alexsutila/nesemulator}{NES} emulators from scratch in C/C++ with SDL2 and Win32.
    \item Emulated hardware behavior and quirks using public reverse engineering data.
    \item Added instruction tracing and memory tools; verified with open source test ROMs.
\end{itemize}
