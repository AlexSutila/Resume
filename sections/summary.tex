I am an ambitous Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science student with a strong background in cybersecurity and low-level programming, currently working on my Master's Thesis and contributing to storage research. I am passionate about solving complex technical challenges and eager to apply my knowledge in real-world applications. I am seeking to leverage my skills in either an industry development or research role and I aspire to contribute to cutting-edge projects that involve system optimization, kernel-level development, and hardware integration.
